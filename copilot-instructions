Role: Senior Frontend Engineer & Architect. Objective: Recreate the provided UI (from screenshots) as a professional, scalable React application.
Technical Stack:
•	Framework: React (Functional Components).
•	Language: TypeScript (Strict Mode).
•	State Management: MobX (Class-based stores).
•	UI Library: Material UI (MUI) v5/v6.
Architecture & Professionalism Rules:
1.	Store-Logic Separation: All business logic (shuffling, drawing, completing items) must reside in a MobX store class. Components must only trigger actions and observe state.
2.	MUI Layout: Use only Stack and Grid for layouts. Never use display: flex in sx props.
3.	Clean Code: No comments. Use highly descriptive naming. Keep components under 100 lines.
4.	Data Handling: Implement a simulated API layer using .then() and .catch() for fetching/saving data.
Features to Implement:
•	Dashboard Header: Top bar with logo and title.
•	Statistics Bar: 4 cards showing: Read Chapters (out of 150), Remaining for Draw, Active Chapters, and Completed Cycles.
•	Interaction Zone: * "Draw" button (Random selection).
•	"Choose Specific" button (Dropdown/Search).
•	Confirmation UI: "I am taking this chapter" vs "Draw another".
•	Active Items List: Cards for items currently in progress with "View" and "Finish" actions.
•	Error States: Styled error alerts for failed data loading.
Visual Style: Rounded corners, subtle shadows, and a clean pastel palette (Orange/Blue/White) as seen in the images.

# Copilot Instructions - High Professionalism Standard

## State Management (MobX)
- State must only be updated within the store using `@action`.
- Use class-based stores with `makeAutoObservable(this)`.
- Components must be wrapped in `observer` to react to state changes.

## UI & Layout (MUI)
- Use MUI components exclusively.
- Layouts: Use `Stack` for 1D and `Grid` for 2D layouts. Never use `display: flex`.
- Styling: Use the `sx` prop or `styled()` utility. Follow the theme system.

## Code Quality
- Single Responsibility: Each component/file handles one thing.
- No comments: Code must be self-explanatory through naming.
- TypeScript: Every prop, state, and function must have a clear interface/type.
- Async: Use `.then().catch()` syntax for API calls; avoid wrapping in unnecessary try/catch blocks.

## Formatting
- Imports: Group external libraries first, then internal code.
- Maintain a clean and minimal component hierarchy.
